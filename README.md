💫 About Me:

Hey there! 👋 I'm Bhuvaneshwaran, a final-year student pursuing a BE degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE). I’m passionate about both hardware and software development, always looking to expand my knowledge. Here’s what I’m currently focused on:

🛠 Enhancing my skills as a web developer, particularly in front-end development using React.

🌐 I enjoy creating intuitive and user-friendly web interfaces while exploring the fundamentals of backend development.

🤝 Open to collaborating on web development projects that integrate engineering concepts with modern technologies.

🌱 Currently deepening my understanding of React to build dynamic and responsive applications.

💡 Learning the basics of backend development to understand how full-stack solutions come together.

🔍 Interested in web accessibility and inclusive design practices to ensure that all users can access and enjoy my projects.

💬 Feel free to connect if you want to discuss blending engineering concepts with web development or optimizing solutions for electronic systems.

🎉 Fun Fact: I once built a mini hydroelectric generator using spare parts from old electronics! ⚡
